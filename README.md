# Michelle's Family Chore Manager

This is a polished, robust Family Chore Manager web application designed to help manage chores for each of our six kids. With drag & drop reordering, persistent storage via `localStorage`, inline editing, and customizable print options, it’s both powerful and easy to use!

## Getting Started

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

## Deployment

This is a static site. You can drag and drop the entire project folder (or push it to GitHub) and deploy it directly on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

The included `netlify.toml` file tells Netlify to publish from the project root.

## Features

- **Multi-child Management:** Keep track of chores for Ember, Lilly, Levi, Eva, Elijah, and Kallie.
- **Add, Edit, Complete, and Delete Chores:** Manage chores quickly with inline editing.
- **Drag & Drop Reordering:** Easily rearrange chores.
- **Persistent Storage:** Chore data is saved in your browser’s localStorage.
- **Custom Print Options:** Print a filtered list of chores (daily, weekly, monthly, or all).

Feel free to modify the files as needed—and enjoy a more organized home!
